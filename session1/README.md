# comp1711 dog
First repository to learn how to use repositories within COMP1711

The hashtag denotes a header
This won't update the repository until we tell it to (using git ...)

git add adds stuff to the staging area (adding stuff into a bucket)
git commit moves the staging area to the repository
git push uploads the local repository to the remote one

commit when you change something large (e.g. fixing a bug or adding a new feature)
add regularly, it doesn't matter, the staging area doesn't remember
commits should be kept meaningful, with meaningful messages
